# Poetry


This is a repository that runs a poem and returns the number of syllables and rhyme scheme.

Run `poetry.py` and a GUI will pop up, allowing you to select a poem text file and the type of poem. Click `analyze poem` to get the rhyme scheme, pronounciation, and number of syllables. 

There are multiple sample poems in the `poetry` folder.
